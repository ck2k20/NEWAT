# Next Session Plan - MapChats Development

## üö® Critical Priority: App Loading Issue Resolution

### Immediate Actions Required
1. **Environment Diagnosis**
   - Test app access from different browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)
   - Verify port 5173 accessibility and forwarding
   - Check development server logs for errors
   - Test localhost vs network IP access

2. **Minimal Test Page**
   - Create simple HTML page to isolate framework issues
   - Test basic React rendering without complex components
   - Verify Vite dev server configuration
   - Check for conflicting processes or port usage

3. **Network & Security Investigation**
   - Review firewall settings and security policies
   - Test from different network environments
   - Check proxy or VPN interference
   - Verify SSL/TLS certificate issues

4. **Fallback Deployment**
   - Consider alternative dev server (webpack-dev-server)
   - Test production build deployment (npm run build + serve)
   - Explore GitHub Codespaces or alternative environments
   - Document working configuration once found

## üéØ Secondary Objectives (After Loading Fixed)

### Phase 3: Real Supabase Integration
- Replace mock data with actual Supabase queries
- Implement proper authentication flow
- Set up real-time user position updates
- Create user profile management system

### Chat System Enhancement  
- Connect user dots to real chat functionality
- Implement message persistence and history
- Add typing indicators and message status
- Create notification system for new messages

### Error Handling & Reliability
- Add React error boundaries to components
- Implement graceful fallbacks for API failures
- Create loading states and retry mechanisms  
- Add offline functionality detection

- [ ] User can interact with map and see user dots
- [ ] Profile cards display correctly on dot clicks
- [ ] No console errors or loading failures

### Technical Success
- [ ] Real Supabase integration working
- [ ] User authentication flow complete
- [ ] Live messaging between users functional
- [ ] Error handling implemented

### Quality Success
- [ ] All features tested and working
- [ ] Code quality maintained (lint, types)
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Performance optimized

## üìù Session Preparation

### Before Starting
1. **Verify Environment**: Ensure dev environment is properly configured
2. **Test Current State**: Confirm development server and builds still work  
3. **Review Issues**: Check for any new problems or dependencies
4. **Plan Approach**: Decide on debugging strategy for loading issues

### Debug Strategy
1. **Systematic Testing**: Start with simplest possible app
2. **Incremental Complexity**: Gradually add features back
3. **Environment Isolation**: Test in different setups
4. **Documentation**: Record what works and what doesn't

### Communication Plan
- Update user immediately when loading issue is resolved
- Provide clear status on feature progress
- Document any changes to development workflow
- Share working URL once application is accessible

---

**Priority Focus**: Fix loading issue first, then continue feature development  
**Success Metric**: User can successfully access and use the MapChats application  
**Fallback Plan**: Alternative deployment method if environment issues persist
